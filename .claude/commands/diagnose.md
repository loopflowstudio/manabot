Find the root cause of slowdowns in the tick loop and observation building.

## Manabot Usage Patterns

**Critical context**: manabot consumes observations IMMEDIATELY after every step() and reset() call. There is no opportunity for lazy or deferred observation creation at the API boundary—the observation is always needed right away.

The training loop:
```python
obs, reward, done, _, info = env.step(action)
# obs is IMMEDIATELY used for:
# - Action selection (neural network forward pass)
# - Validation
# - Buffer storage
# - Actor index extraction
new_actor_ids = get_agent_indices(obs)  # Uses ALL observation fields
```

**Implications for optimization:**
- "Lazy observation" at the API level provides NO benefit
- "Deferred field population" doesn't help—ALL fields are used
- Focus on making observation building FAST, not on deferring it
- The only valid "lazy" optimization is avoiding observation creation during internal ticks (skip_trivial loop), which is already implemented

## The two hot paths

1. **Tick loop**: `Game::step()` → `_step()` → `tick()` → `TurnSystem::tick()`
   - game.cpp:205-241 — step() calls _step(), which executes the action and calls tick()
   - game.cpp:225-241 — tick() loops calling TurnSystem::tick() until ActionSpace available
   - turn.cpp:147-160 — TurnSystem::tick() advances turn/phase/step state

2. **Observation building**: Called after every step(), must be fast
   - observation.cpp:22-39 — constructor calls five populate* functions
   - populateTurn (45-62): turn/phase/step/player IDs
   - populateActionSpace (64-77): copies action options
   - populatePlayers (79-117): player state and zone counts
   - populateCards (119-153): hand, graveyard, exile, stack
   - populatePermanents (189-202): battlefield state

## Workflow

1. Read the latest `.design/profile-*.md`
2. Identify where time goes: tick loop vs observation vs unaccounted
3. Read the relevant code and find WHY it's slow
4. Write `.design/diagnosis.md`

## What to look for

**In the tick loop:**
- How many ticks per step? (profile shows tick count vs step count)
- What happens in each tick? Phase transitions? Priority checks?
- Is skip_trivial doing too much work? (game.cpp:210-212)

**In observation building:**
- Which populate* function dominates?
- Are we copying data that could be referenced?
- Are we iterating collections multiple times?

**In the unaccounted gap:**
- Action execution time (game.cpp:197)
- The skip_trivial loop (game.cpp:210-212 calls _step repeatedly)
- Zone lookups, player iteration, other per-step overhead

## Output

`.design/diagnosis.md`:

```markdown
# Diagnosis

## Summary
<One paragraph: what's slow and why>

## Primary bottleneck
**Where**: <file:line>
**Time**: X% of step
**Why**: <specific cause>

## Secondary bottlenecks
<Same format, in order of impact>

## Unaccounted time
<What's in the gap? What instrumentation would reveal it?>

## Recommendations
<Ordered by impact, with specific file:line targets>
```

Be specific. "Observation is slow" is useless. "populatePermanents iterates battlefield twice (observation.cpp:197, 221)" is actionable.
