# MTG-213 — current decisions and assumptions (2026-11-04 UTC)

Execution status and remaining acceptance: `scratch/tla-pilot-postmerge-verify.md`.
Results, costs and retained receipts: `experiments/tla-trophy-pilot.md`.
Current contract: `experiments/protocols/tla-trophy-213-v9.md` and its JSON/regime.
V9 Run `2171156493ca` is frozen and unsubmitted; provider quotes refused capacity
or price. No trained endpoint exists. Shipping PR #423 did not complete MTG-213.

## Accepted direction and ownership

Jack Heart's comment 1540e0ad selects preliminary fixed-corpus TLA self-play
and evaluation now, superseding the deferred Task brief. Comment 6434b4dd
authorizes GPUs under a hard USD10 cumulative cap and shipping enabling fixes
after checks. Comment d2108241 requires reporting actual GPU learner updates
with job/GPU/progress/rate/deadline evidence. V5 reached that milestone but
stopped before exporting a trained checkpoint; quotes and CPU proofs do not
satisfy it. A new allocation remains capped at USD1, including setup and teardown.

Comment 42a12145 approved shared-effect fixed tensors, encoding each effect
once and routing it to affected object embeddings before attention. Task 5da5f4
delivered PR #419 and owns redundant-activation investigation and its separate
budget. T6/T7 keep their rules ownership. The primary conversation released
Etude 0.2.14; no competing representation repair or release is selected.

Comments f61beeb7 and 3b0f8826 require native legality/payability first, then an
explicit deterministic first-64 legal-action cutoff with replay-linked diagnostics.
Comment ffd29028 records Jack Heart's concept-review answer **1b**: apply the
same prefix to heuristic, learned candidate and initialization anchor. V9 and
merged PR #423 implement it, superseding v8's full-support heuristic interpretation
and v6/v7's 512-action plans. Historical Wave memory describing that heuristic
is superseded by this decision. Prepared v6/v7/v8 Runs must not launch.

The engine and Academy retain all legal choices. Retained row i executes original
native Command i; heuristic restriction precedes scoring/fallback. Padding is
masked, with no pagination. Later legal actions have zero probability on overflow;
ordering neutrality and strategic redundancy are not established. Diagnostics
count consumed decisions across all participating policies, not learner-only or
actor-specific rates. Samples cannot reconstruct exact actor totals. Normal close
flushes totals; abrupt termination can lose counts since the last flush. A cutoff
is not a failed game; a rules error remains a rules error.

## Scientific contract and evidence limits

- Population: CC BY 4.0 public TLA PremierDraft dump; the trophy API restricts
  reuse to 17Lands.com. First 1,000 events with seven observed wins in source
  order, retaining seventh-win main/sideboards and event/build/results. Missing
  losses remain unknown. Whole-list admission yielded 134 eligible and 866
  rejected without resampling or substitutions. Each seat draws independently,
  including mirrors. Live fetching and held-out-deck generalization are deferred.
  A later 306-list admission audit does not expand the frozen 134.
- Recipe: MTG-181/183's 64x2/four-head damped policy, with explicit new-world,
  full-vocabulary and trophy-population deviations; no checkpoint or budget
  inheritance. The 100-update target, 2,700-second watchdog and eight-pair/four-leg
  evaluation are frozen engineering choices. V9 retains input-v7 shared effects,
  128 cards per seat and the original recipe, seeds and schedule.
- Compatibility: executed protocols/configurations/evidence are immutable.
  Source/world/shape changes need prospective identities and fresh initialization
  and evaluation; a common w17 label does not establish compatibility. V1's 140
  facts motivated v6/256 (512 was the operator's initial choice, 256 followed
  Jack Heart's confirmation); v3's 270 facts invalidated that capacity. Shared
  effects repaired that case, then v4 needed 61 card rows and v5 exposed illegal
  X offers. None of these repairs guarantees universal reachable-state capacity.
  Frozen input v5 stays at 128 facts; fresh v6 defaults to 512, with rank / 128
  timestamp scaling. Synthetic world fixtures never authorize real execution.
- Analysis: retain milestones after early endpoints and both comparison slots
  for unknown endpoints. Failed callbacks count as failed matches; unknown games
  remain missing and attempted games are a lower bound. The companion analysis
  CLI owns the joint criterion; Etude curves are descriptive. New games cannot
  fill historical missing slots or reconstruct lost optimizer state from counters.
  GPU execution alone supplies no learning-gain or Elemental-relative pace claim.

## Operational choices

Nested Doppler `manabot/prd` then `etude/prd` supplies artifacts and provider
credentials without copying secrets. Use the published isolated Etude 0.2.14
control client; frozen workers retain 0.2.12. Freeze source once through
`source.freeze`, retain the typed Run, and quote/submit through
`client.launch_cohort`. Etude 0.2.12 could not append cohort runs, so the historical
`mtg213-pilot-v1-correction1` used a separate USD1 ceiling without creating a new
scientific sample. Neither that workaround nor another Task replenishes USD10.

Configured GPU alternatives are authorized within the existing caps; record
hardware/allocation deviations before scoring and retain CUDA numerical admission.
Quotes reserve nothing. Reconcile fresh inventory, bills and whole-rental quotes
before allocation; per-run cost can omit setup/idle cleanup. Never change or charge
another Task's rental. VAST_API_KEY remains in `etude/prd`; the SSH public key was
registered. Prior Vast placement used >=6 vCPUs, >=48GB RAM, 80GB disk,
<=USD0.81/hour and 840 seconds setup plus the unchanged one-hour job.

At 20:49 UTC the operator selected configured RunPod A4000 after RTX5090 price
and RTX3090/L4/A6000 supply refusals. Its availability read quoted USD0.25/hour,
>=16 vCPUs/48GB RAM and 50GB disk; the one-hour job plus 900s setup must still
quote <=USD1. Its subsequent quote refused capacity, so no submission occurred.
This was a placement assumption, not a protocol change or additional allowance.
Evidence remains in `experiments/data/mtg213/gpu-v9-preflight-20261104/`;
independently owned Vast rental 59159114 / representation Run 886233843d34 was
untouched. GPU memory and throughput equivalence are not assumed.

## Historical context

Completed review drafts, proof requests and CI repair narration no longer direct
work. Their full pre-compression text is retained at
`6da60684cb628ec9b431dbbb9d7dc91348743622:scratch/questions.md`; the uncommitted
20:49 placement addition is preserved above and in preflight artifacts. The
pre-compression local blob is `b1f764aa2b078aa4a28b8d607cba6f505d685b07`.
Older decisions/source pins remain at
`af4227616ef2cf46bb1f0b05e690feebb28ac2e8:scratch/questions.md`.
Inherited T6/T7 notes remain at
`5cd6ed3f6e54e81f9f39c5c2bb56f322dc1576c1:scratch/questions.md` and
`4463e57f5a92ebd3b60e2fb50c046b84ac2c0372:scratch/questions.md`;
they do not replace MTG-213's direction. Cleared demo/verification plans remain
at `d2ff60e6a^:scratch/tla-pilot-demo.md` and
`d2ff60e6a^:scratch/tla-pilot-verify.md`.
