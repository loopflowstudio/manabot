# MTG-329 plan

2026-11-12 naming direction, Jack Heart: "why is _verify_checkpoint private -- in etude i saw that we had instructions to keep functions private if they werent used outside, but i dont think thats necessary and find that to be distracting".

2026-11-12 recipe interface review, Jack Heart: "im not sure i liek this set u     self_play: SelfPlay = Field(default_factory=elemental_self_play)" and "i liekd it better when there were explicit eval(), train() and launch() functions". He clarified: "the idea was just to expose more primitives in etude to facilitate the ML OPs part of the train loop" and "but not to change the overall structure of hte recipe files". Preserve the existing recipe-file structure and explicit operations. Expose and use Etude primitives for the loop's ML operations; do not introduce a recipe framework or require the prototype's nested `ElementalConfig.self_play` structure. This narrows the prototype direction above; the proposed recipe restructuring is not the intended outcome.

Further clarification, Jack Heart: "well, to move the thigns that were in the execution loop itno things that are provided as general tools by etude" and "so they dont have to be in a 1000 line file". The intended simplification is extracting reusable ML operations from the large manabot executor into general Etude tools, then calling those tools from ordinary training code while preserving recipe-file structure. Merely adding conveniences around the existing executor would not achieve this outcome.

Approach (task): prototype manabot against the ideal Etude API → review at
demo → build the Etude API (its own linked Task/PR) → land the manabot diff
that deletes `execution.py`.

## Current status — 2026-11-13

The cutover is implemented against EXP-56's real SDK source. See
`implementation.md` for the deletion inventory, focused proof and remaining
release dependency. `cutover.md` is the accepted implementation direction;
`config-api-direction.md` records the Pydantic interface direction.

Earlier prototype progress, smoke transcripts and parity results remain in
`f09f5c2919b8b1a5cf6d72c4f4f4721dac68f653:scratch/plan.md` and `etude-api.md`.
Those prototype results predate the main/backend merge; they do not prove
post-merge parity. The old final.pt, local stub and nested recipe config are
superseded by immutable checkpoint paths and ordinary typed train functions.

## Delete — do not maintain

Deleted the executor, stage/recovery admission, recovery state, local scheduler,
monitor follower, study launcher, RunContext and proposed_etude stub. Their
exclusive tests were removed; mixed tests retain model, collector, record and
evaluation coverage. The complete path inventory is in implementation.md. Compress also removed
unused attack registration, Elemental parent staging, value-readout launch helpers,
CUDA capture hooks and profiler-only state. Public frozen execution refusals and
historical report/data readers remain; no further deletion target is pending.
The obsolete attack executor tests now check refusal without creating a cohort.
The former recovery CI group only held pretrained loading; it joins training.

The CLI selects each built-in function/config pair in one table. The loop saves
resume state once when persistence and checkpoint cadences coincide, before
publishing the policy; docs use the same ordering.

Preserve saved TrainingRegime/TrainingRun and comparison records, serialized
checkpoint keys, world binding, game-error ledgers/replay and failure capture,
paired deals and training seeds. Current callers use train(config), real Etude
tracking and jobs.training. Frozen execution refuses with the last executable
revision; it is not translated to different learning semantics.

## Remaining work

1. Release EXP-56, raise every Etude requirement and the runtime pin together,
   refresh uv.lock and verify isolated/installed consumers. SDK 0.2.16 cannot
   run this branch. No local dependency path is committed.
2. Gate the affected suites, including the retained game-error replay issue
   below. Demo/review the explicit loss of in-collection/source-repair recovery.
3. Prove actual launch output restoration/retry and service continuation once
   the SDK/service are available; local target continuation and etude.call are
   exercised. Publishing and landing are later Graph steps.

## Contrary finding from the main sync

The earlier merge check passed 173 learner/collector/backend/admission/artifact/
boundary tests. Three variants of
`test_resource_limit_receipt_replays_its_retained_encoding_boundary` failed
`binding_mismatch`: replayed frame schema 8 versus retained fixture schema 7
(`tests/fixtures/tla-pilot-permanent-capacity.jsonl`). Comparison and fixture
matched main, whose CI was green. This pass leaves frozen evidence unchanged;
gate must resolve or explicitly report the failure, not regenerate it away.

Check results for this cutover are recorded once in implementation.md.
